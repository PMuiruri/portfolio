			<p>I am deeply fascinated by digital services and their ability to create new and personalized experiences.  I am a Frontend developer with about two and half yearsâ€™ hands on experience working with modern web development languages, libraries, and frameworks.</p>
			<p>My best value is the constant curiosity and positive attitude towards learning new things. I often find myself trying out new technologies and I am not afraid of a challenge or to try something completely new.</p>
			<p>I am currently seeking new opportunities and new problems to solve. Please get in touch I would love to talk to you.</p>

						<p>This is a simple tip calculator that helps customers calculate tip amount for various percentages of the cost of the service, and also provides a total amount that includes the tip. It can also split the bill based on number of people and provides the customer with tip amount and total per person. This is a solution to the Tip calculator app challenge by FrontendMentors. I used this challenge to learn how to build resuable styled components. </p>
